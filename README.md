# WebDesign1FinalManelski

For this final project in our Web Design 1 course at Wilmington University we were tasked with making a design layout for a made up website of our choosing. 


I decided to go with a fake website devoted to being a one stop shop for all rubix cubing needs called the "cubing teacher". It is designed to teach the user to solve any cube they wish to solve. The site was programmed on a website called glitch (a project management site for web based sites). It was programmed in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.No graphics were used (besides the logo) due to time constraints (and graphics not being required by the professor).


The site itself features 3 core sections. Those are the home page, content page, and FAQ page. The home page is simple in concept with it being a simple explanation for the user. The content page consists of all the tabs for the users to navigate through to see the given design layout for our made up website. Those tabs are color, typography, buttons, and layout. Within the FAQ page there is an about, FAQ, and designers tab (designers and about do nothing as that is a "coming soon" feature). The site also has a footer on each page to navigate the user to any part of the site.


Below will be a link to the site via Glitch webpage where they have a live site share option.
